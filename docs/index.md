These docs catalog player-made software for EverQuest, with a focus on multiboxing. Most everything is based on the open-source MacroQuest platform.

Our featured page is the [Command Index](Command_Index.md): a single, customizable page of in-game commands.

If we're missing something important, please consider [Adding a manual](Adding_a_manual.md), and if you're feeling generous with your time, look at [Wanted](Wanted.md).
